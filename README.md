# Hello-Javascript

This is my first repo in learing javascript, here we will learn How javascript executes

1. Javascript is executed in execution Context
2. In Execution context we have two components
3. a. memory b. code-context
4. in memory we will store all the variables in a key value pair and value of the variable will be undefined
5. then when we execute the code it will run in code context where it will store the real value of variable
